# 3.ArcPy-AddIns
Addins add a GUI element to ArcGIS and increase usability.

* More sophisticated GUI elements, such as drop-down comboboxes.
* The ability to communicate between addins, linking several GUI elements together.
* The ability to respond to Arc events beyond the GUI with application extensions.
* Access to the elements of the pythonaddins module (as with other script tools).

In total, these make addins significantly more useful than standard scripts.
